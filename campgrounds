Deua River, Bakers Flat and Dry Creek, spaced along the she-oak lined Deua River, are all great places to camp. Whatever the season, come and enjoy these scenic riverside camping locations, from where you can explore the park or take a day trip to the coast.  In the warmer months, goannas patrol the campgrounds while the semi-aquatic eastern water dragons oversee the goings-on in the river. Youâ€™re most likely to spot them sunning themselves on a rock or a branch overhanging the water. Their long muscular tail helps them swim. So make like a water dragon and jump on in.  There are plenty of things to do at Deua River campgrounds, all of which involve relaxation. Walk alongside the river to explore the area a bit more, find a picnic spot on the bank, do a bit of birdwatching to see how many species you can see, and then enjoy a barbecue dinner back at your campsite.
